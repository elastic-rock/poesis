# Security Policy

Please do not report security vulnerabilities publicly

If you believe you found a security vulnerability on the website, you are encouraged to reach out at hello@poesis.io

I will try to get in touch with you as soon as possible to discuss the matter and if needed, patch the vulnerability. After patching, the vulnerability will be publicly disclosed and your contribution recognised by listing your name in the changelog or, upon request, other methods deemed relevant. You can then optional make a public disclosure yourself.

Thank you!
